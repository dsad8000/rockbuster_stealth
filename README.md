3. Introduce initial service plan incentives for high lifetime value customers. #### Customers in the top quarter of revenue are 19% or more of customers in our top 10 revenue countries. A loyalty plan to reward these customers with incentives for the initial service plan will provide data to analyze rental trends for targeted local marketing campaigns.
